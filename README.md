# INTRODUCTION
I'm Tom, a passionate tech enthusiast on a journey to become a skilled Python developer and delve into the realms of software engineering and data analytics. I am a self-taught developer, gaining most of my knowledge through online courses, YouTube and bootcamps. 

## ABOUT ME
I love to learn, solve problems and have a keen interest in data and how it is used. My journey began when I was first introduced to basic programming during my final year at university. This sparked an interest to pursue learning Python in my own time, where I enrolled myself in a variety of online courses. This didn't stop here; I found out about the HyperionDev CoGrammar Skills bootcamp, where I have been learning Python and key concepts in software development such as **data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and system design**.

## SKILLS:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks/ Tools/ Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, django, dash, scikit-learn, Git, GitHub, Command Line 

## PROJECTS:

Check out some of my projects 

1. [Project 1: Python Task Manager](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/finalCapstone)
       This project uses Python and the terminal to show/ prompt the user to add, view, report etc tasks.   
2. [Project 2: Python S&P500 Company Tracker](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/sp_500_tracker)
       This project uses Python, matplotlib, yfinance, to track the top 500 companies in the US. 
3. [Project 3: Python Tic, Tac, Toe](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/python_tic_tac_toe)
       This project uses Python, itertools and colorama and the terminal to play a game of tic-tac-toe. Up to 2 players.
4. [Project 4: Python Machine Learning](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/python_diamonds)
       This project uses Python, pandas, scikit-learn to predict the price of diamonds.        
5. [Project 5: JavaScript Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/etch-a-sketch)
       This project uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create an interactive etch-a-sketch allowing the user to draw. 

Some of the Bootcamps / Courses I have completed: 
- [HyperionDev / CoGrammar Skills Bootcamp - Software Engineering Python](https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/TB23110010900/) 
- The Odin project JavaScript Foundations
