- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my first project whether that be Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- Let's connect! I am open to collaboration, networking and new opportunities. Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-bergmanis-540262171

# INTRODUCTION
I'm Tom, a passionate tech enthusiast on a journey to become a skilled Python developer and delve into the realms of software engineering and data analytics. I am a self-taught developer, gaining most of my knowledge through online courses and bootcamps. 

## ABOUT ME
I love to learn, solve problems and have a keen interest in data and how it is used. My journey began when I was first introduced to basic programming during my final year at university. This sparked an interest to pursue learning Python in my own time, where I enrolled myself in a variety of online courses. This didn't stop here; I found out about the HyperionDev CoGrammar Skills boot camp, where I have been learning Python and key concepts in software development such as **data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and system design**.

I am currently an acoustic consultant (nothing to do with acoustic guitars!) travelling up and down the UK collecting noise data to use in assessments for construction and built envrionments. This involves a lot of data processing, data analysing and Excel. 
I am also a part-time product tester for Jenson8 which is using VR / gamified Psychometric testing to provide insight into workforce metrics such as teamwork, leadership, problem-solving etc. I hoping the role will expand out into a technical support role so I can transistion to the tech industry, away from the acoustics industry. I believe that my transferable skills and commitment to continuous learning will enable me to thrive in a technical role and hopefully onto a development/engineering or data analyst role. 

## SKILLS:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Frameworks/ Tools: Git, CitHub, Command Line 

I am also looking to learn SQL, Power BI in the near future. 

## PROJECTS:

Check out some of my projects 

1. [Project 1: Python Task Manager](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/task_manager_python)
2. Project 2
3. [Project 3: JavaScript Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/etch-a-sketch) 

## CONTINUOUS LEARNING:
One of the main reasons I aspire to work with technology is that I love to continuously learn and add new skills to my "toolbelt" as it makes me feel good to challenge myself and succeed in honing those new skills. 
One of the key features of working in technology and particularly within software development is continuous development. Whether that is learning new languages, frameworks, etc., or soft skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership... It is important to know that there is always more to learn or improve on.

Some of the Bootcamps / Courses I have completed: 
- [HyperionDev / CoGrammar Skills Bootcamp - Software Engineering Python](https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/TB23110010900/) 
- The Odin project JavaScript Foundations
