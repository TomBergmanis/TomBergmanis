# INTRODUCTION
I'm Tom, a passionate tech enthusiast on a journey to become a skilled Python developer and delve into the realms of software engineering and data analytics. I am a self-taught developer, gaining most of my knowledge through online courses and bootcamps. 

## ABOUT ME
I love to learn, solve problems and have a keen interest in data and how it is used. My journey began when I was first introduced to basic programming during my final year at university. This sparked an interest to pursue learning Python in my own time, where I enrolled myself in a variety of online courses. This didn't stop here; I found out about the HyperionDev CoGrammar Skills boot camp, where I have been learning Python and key concepts in software development such as **data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and system design**.

## SKILLS:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Frameworks/ Tools: Git, CitHub, Command Line 

## Recent Projects:

Check out some of my recent projects

1. [Project 1: Python Task Manager](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/task_manager_python)
2. Project 2
3. [Project 3: JavaScript Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/TomBergmanis/etch-a-sketch) 

## Continuous Learning:
One of the main reasons I aspire to work with technology is that I love to continuously learn and add new skills to my "toolbelt" as it makes me feel good to challenge myself and succeed in honing those new skills. 
One of the key features of working in technology and particularly within software development is continuous development. Whether that is learning new languages, frameworks, etc., or soft skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership... It is important to know that there is always more to learn or improve on.

Some of the Bootcamps / Courses I have completed: 
- HyperionDev / CoGrammar Skills Bootcamp - Software Engineering Python
- The Odin project JavaScript Foundations
