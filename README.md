### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# INTRODUCTION
I'm Tom, a passionate tech enthusiast on a journey to become a skilled Python developer and 
delve into the realms of software engineering and data analytics. I am a self-taught developer
gaining most of my knowledge through online courses and bootcamps. 

# ABOUT ME
I love to solve problems and have a keen interest in data and how it is used. 
My journey began when I was first introduced to Python during my final year at university. 
This sparked an interest to pursue learning Python in my own time where I enrolled myself 
on a variety of online courses. This didn't stop here, I found out about the HyperionDev CoGrammar 
Skills bootcamp teaching Python  and software engineering skills such as, **data structures and algorithms,
object oriented programming and system design**.
